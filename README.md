## About the sample

- You can use Flutter-supported IDEs such as Android Studio or Visual Studio.
  This project has been tested on Android Studio Flamingo.
- Before building, ensure that you have downloaded the model and the labels by
  following a set of instructions.
- All heavy operations are performed in a separate background isolate.
- This sample supports for still images and live camera streams. You can
  switch between these modes using the bottom bar.

### Still image mode

You have the option to either select an image from your device or capture a new
photo to classify.
